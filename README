# GEM Weather Model Access Portal

GEM Weather Model Access Portal is a Django application for downloading and visualization weather forecast data from the
Global Deterministic Prediction System (GDPS) of the Global Environmental Multiscale (GEM) weather model from 
Environment Canada.

## Background

This application contains a technical approach for a functioning data visualization dashboard, which can serve to assist
residents in remote regions of the world to better prepare for weather events. The prototype developed as part of this 
project relies on the Django framework, Plotly visualization tools and Dash apps. A case study is deployed as a proof of
concept over the nation of Pakistan, which is vulnerable to extreme weather events. 

## Requirements
